# Challenge Templates

Base templates for our different roles are hosted on different branches. **When you're forking this repository, make sure you're not forking just the main branch!**

## Roles

### ReactJS

```bash
git checkout templates/react
```

### Node.js

```bash
git checkout templates/node
```

Once you've swapped branches, you should see more information on getting up and running for the templates for the respective role you're building a challenge for.
